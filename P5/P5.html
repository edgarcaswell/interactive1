	<div id="subtitle">safe search engines</div>

	<div id="container">

	<div id="info">Every search you conduct using Google's ubiquitous search engine – for medical or mental health information, an update on your favorite mayoral candidate, the schedule of your church's potluck dinner, how to handle kids' tantrums, the cure for halitosis or the latest sex toys – allows the company to track your interests and, over time, build a detailed dossier that describes virtually every aspect of your character, food preferences, religious beliefs, medical problems, sexual inclinations, parenting challenges, political leanings and so on. In other words, when you use Google's search engine, Google's gotcha.

	<div id="info2">google's tracking practices.</div>

	<div id="info3">Even if the company doesn't know your name, it can still track your searches by reading codes, such as your IP address, that are unique to your computer or current location. Through cross-referencing, the company can eventually find your name, address, and telephone number, too. When you use the search engine or most any other Google product, Google also installs an identifier cookie on your computer that makes you easier to track. And get this: Google reads and stores every letter you type into its search bar as you are typing (think: m-a-r-i-j-u-a), so even if your good judgment suddenly kicks in and you don't hit "enter," the company still records what it thinks you were looking for.
</div>

	<div id="info4">Google uses your search history to send you personalized ads. That's how it survives, after all. About 97 percent of the company's revenues are from advertising. Google justifies this business model, which could be viewed as fundamentally deceptive, by insisting that it's providing a unique and valuable service: sending vendors your way who precisely fit your current needs and interests.
</div>

	<div id="info5">Alternatives to Google.</div>

	<div id="info6">There are other search engine services out there that do not track or record your searches and offer a more private internet experience. 
	1.DUCK DUCK GO  2. IXQUICK

	3.BLEKKO</div>

	<div id="info7">by using these alternative search engines that do not track your activity, you as a member of the age of information can search and gather information freely and without the ulterior motives of large companies such as Google and Yahoo. Google and Yahoo use your search history to create an enigmatic picture of an invidual and has questionable morals in doing so. Does google have your best interest at heart? I do not think so. So just to be safe, use alternative search engines to combat against google.</div>
